 * Holds the song being read, which is not always the one the page was built from.

 * Song pages are generated at build time and precached, so an edit saved between
 * two deploys exists only in the database. Before this, saving looked like losing:
 * the sheet did not change, and reopening the form showed the old words back
 * again, because the form was filled from the page rather than from the database.
 *
 * Three sources: the copy baked into the page, the copy this browser cached the
 * last time it learned of an edit, then the database — each shown only if it is
 * newer than the baked one. The editor writes into that cache as it saves, which is
 * why coming back from it shows the new words before the server is asked anything.
 *
 * "Newer" is always measured against the baked copy — never against the cache, and
 * never against a clock in the browser. That is what lets the cached edit survive
 * exactly as long as it is needed: it keeps showing through the whole deploy that
 * is busy baking it in, and stops the moment the new page arrives carrying it.
 *
 * The provider is keyed by slug where it is used, so stepping to the next song
 * cannot leave the previous song's state behind.
